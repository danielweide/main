== Project: ConnectUs
ConnectUs is a desktop address book application used to store contact information such as name, phone, email and address.
The user can tag entries for more efficient search and can open up an email client to send an email. The GUI displays the list of contacts as well as additional information
such as his/her address on Google Maps. The user interacts with it using a CLI, although there are additional GUI elements created in JavaFX such as a form to edit contacts, and a QR generator for you to scan
the contact's number and automatically port it to your smartphone. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

==== Justification

"Edit profile" form was implemented because so as to enhance user efficiency in using the application. It would be hard for users to manually remember the commands, also, typing the commands exposes the user to potential input errors. +
"Google maps" was implemented because displaying the location of a contact would prove useful to users who require
location based services such as food delivery and door to door services. +
"Email" feature was implemented because it can be tedious to manually find and organise emails. With the email function, emailing contacts is one click/command away. Similar to edit profile, automatically filling up +
the "to:" field in the email minimises the chance of human error.
